# The Gist
This is a rushed program; An HTML5-based music player that runs right in the browser.
This contains:
- Playlists
- Playback speed
- Song looping (A/B, one song, all songs, none)
- Album art, song artist, genre, etc. labels
- Themes
- Mobile and PC compatibility
- And a bit more

# How To Use It
Load it up, open the playlist menu if on mobile, click/tap the import songs button, and start playing songs!

# Heads Up!
Playlists stay in cached storage, but skngs need to be re-imported on future startups.

This is still very buggy, and may get updates here and there.
